          Important notes with Figma:

          if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
          some values are in float - feel free to round them
          “Be pixel perfect” - yes! but mainly make sure colors, size and position are correct. #C271FF is not purple.
